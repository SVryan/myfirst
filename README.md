My first rspirstory to store and write
I will write on the Bioinformatics workshop we have had from 23rd january to 27th january 2023


## Day One
**Installation of tools**
1. *Download shell-lesson-data.zip and move the file to your Desktop.*
2. *Unzip/extract the file. Let your instructor know if you need help with this step. You should end up with a new folder called shell-lesson-data on your Desktop*

Install:
1. Gitbash
2. R studio

## Day Two
**Introduction to commands**
**Introducing shell**
-*A shell is a program whose primary purpose is to read commands and run other programs.*
-*This lesson uses Bash, the default shell in many implementations of Unix.*
-*Programs can be run in Bash by entering commands at the command-line prompt.*
-*The shell’s main advantages are its high action-to-keystroke ratio, its support for automating repetitive tasks, and its capacity to access networked machines.*
-*The shell’s main disadvantages are its primarily textual nature and how cryptic its commands and operation can be.*



## Day Three
